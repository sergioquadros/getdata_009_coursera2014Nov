##  README

_Ubuntu 14.04 LTS =  i686-pc-linux-gnu (32-bit)_
_R version 3.1.2 (2014-10-31) -- "Pumpkin Helmet"_
_RStudio version 0.98.1074_

Our script isn't **OS** agnostic, this means that it was maked in an linux environment and for another one, maybe it's necessary some adjustments. 

Access [run_analisys.R](<https://github.com/sergioquadros/getdata_009_coursera2014Nov/blob/master/run_analisys.R>) script here or in a copy below.

This script produces three files in flat plain text format:
1.  "**first_tidy.txt**"
2.  "**tidy2.txt**"
3.  "**tidy3.txt**"
