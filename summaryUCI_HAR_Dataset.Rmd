We have this structure in [zip file](<https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>) from the HAR dataset:
* README.txt:
    + Method:
        + 30 volunteers(19-48 years)
        + 6 activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone
        + Video-recorded to label the data manually. Dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets: 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
        + The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window that was stored in Inertials Signals files). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of 561 features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain that was stored in X_test.txt and X_train.txt files.
        + 'train/X_train.txt' (); 'train/y_train.txt' (Training labels); 'test/X_test.txt' (Test set); 'test/y_test.txt' (Test labels).
* features_info.txt:
    + information about the variables used on the feature vector: accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ(*'t'* time domain)and filters->linear acceleration and angular velocity=Jerk signals(Euclidean norm)->Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) obtain  *'f'* frequency domain->The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: mean(),std(), etc->By averaging the signals are used on the angle() variable: gravityMean, tBodyAccMean, tBodyAccJerkMean, tBodyGyroMean, tBodyGyroJerkMean. The hole list in features.txt
* features.txt:
    + list of 561 names of variables dim(561, 2): 
1 tBodyAcc-mean()-X
2 tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
3 tBodyAcc-mean()-Z
....
558 angle(tBodyGyroJerkMean,gravityMean)
559 angle(X,gravityMean)
560 angle(Y,gravityMean)
561 angle(Z,gravityMean)
* activity_labels.txt: 
     + Links the class labels with their activity name: 1 WALKING
2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 SITTING
5 STANDING
6 LAYING
